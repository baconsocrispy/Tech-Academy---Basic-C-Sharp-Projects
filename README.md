# Tech-Academy---Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

## Introduction

This repository includes all of my work from the C# and .NET course through The Tech Academy, summer 2022. The course provided an introduction to object oriented programming in C# as well as the .NET and .NET Core frameworks. Most of the assignments demonstrate basic understanding of various C# fundamentals, while other larger projects, such as the Black Jack game and the Car Insurance app, show how C# fundamentals fit together in the context of the .NET Framework and app creation. 

## Projects

- Black Jack Game
- Car Insurance App

# Black Jack Game

The Black Jack Game is a console application, built in C#/.Net Framework, using Visual Studio 2022. The game prompts a user for his/her name and the amount of money they've brought along. From there, the user plays Black Jack, aka Twenty One, against an automated dealer. The game runs until the user loses all their money or decides to quit. 

The the game utilizes a comprehensive amount of C# coding fundamentals: class/struct/interface/enum creation, basic data types, looping/iteration, exception handling, inheritance/abstract classes, etc. It also demonstrates how code can be bundled up in a package and referenced from another program. 

# Car Insurance App

The Car Insurance App is a .NET MVC Web Application that gathers webform information about an Insuree and then creates a quote based on the obtained criteria. The app makes use of the Entity Framework and stores insuree information in a Sequel Server database. In addition to serving as an introduction to .NET-specific MVC and the Entity Framework, the project introduced Razor syntax and basic CRUD implementation.
